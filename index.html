                <h1>Welcome to the Algonquin Animal Adoption Centre!</h1>
                <p>Wisdom Pet Medicine was founded by Dr. Darren Winthrop, Dr.    Elizabeth Chase, and Dr. Kimberly Sanders to bring the best in   traditional and  alternative medicine to the local community. The three   doctors met while pursuing  their veterinary education at Colorado State   University, one of the nation's  top-rated vet schools. After going   their own ways (for almost a decade), to  work for different veterinary   clinics across the country, the doctors decided  it was time to combine   their diverse knowledge and skills under one practice at  Wisdom Pet   Medicine.</p>
                <p>Staying up on the latest technology and procedures, empowers us to   diagnose  and treat more conditions in-house, rather than having to ship   your pet out to  a specialist's office. Our goal is to help keep your   love ones comfortable by  keeping them in friendly and familiar   surroundings for the duration of their  care. </p>
                <p>Our veterinary hospital provides general and specialty vet  medicine,   and serves as a major surgical center in the region. We're often    referred difficult cases from other vet clinics throughout the region,   state,  and country, and even treat cases from other countries. </p>
                <p>We all love animals and strive to make your pet's experience as   positive  as possible. This is why we have a pet play yard in the back   of our clinic  where we give our overnight visitors regular time away   from the stress of  confinement and treatment. </p>
                <p>We  are proud to say that most of our patients come in wagging their   tails happily  on return visits â€“ a true indicator that we've made them   feel safe and secure.  We're honored that you've entrusted your pet's   care to us, and we'll stand by  our commitment to provide the absolute   best in veterinary medicine.</p>
